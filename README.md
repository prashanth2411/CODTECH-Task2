TASK-->STUDENT GRADE TRACKER:
The Student Grade Manager is a Java-based application designed to simplify the process of tracking and managing student grades. The core functionality of the program revolves around allowing users to input grades for various subjects, compute the average grade, and display the overall grade along with a corresponding letter grade.The user interface is menu-driven, providing a straightforward experience with options to add grades, calculate the average, and display the overall grade.

To calculate the average grade, the program sums all the entered grades and divides by the number of subjects. This average is then displayed to the user. Additionally, the program translates the numeric average into a letter grade based on a standard academic grading scale (A for 90-100, B for 80-89, and so on), offering a clear understanding of the student's performance.

The Student Grade Manager is modular and scalable, allowing for potential enhancements such as GPA calculation, support for multiple students, and persistent storage of data. This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as user input handling, data storage with HashMap, and basic control flow structures in Java. It serves as an educational tool for students learning Java, providing practical experience with building a functional application. Overall, the Student Grade Manager offers a practical solution for educators, students, and parents to manage and assess academic performanceÂ effectively.


A student grade tracker is an essential tool designed to help students, teachers, and parents monitor and manage academic performance efficiently. This system provides a centralized platform where grades for assignments, tests, projects, and overall subjects can be recorded, tracked, and analyzed over time.

For students, a grade tracker offers a clear view of their academic progress, highlighting strengths and areas needing improvement. It allows them to set realistic goals, stay motivated, and take proactive steps to enhance their performance. With real-time updates, students can continuously monitor their progress and make necessary adjustments to their study habits.

Teachers benefit from a grade tracker by having a streamlined method for recording and organizing student grades. This tool simplifies the grading process, reduces administrative workload, and ensures accuracy and consistency in assessing student performance. Teachers can also generate comprehensive reports that provide insights into class performance trends, individual student progress, and identify those who may need additional support.

Parents gain valuable insights into their child's academic journey through a grade tracker. They can stay informed about their child's achievements and areas of struggle, enabling them to provide timely support and encouragement. Regular updates and notifications ensure parents are always aware of their child's academic standing.

Modern student grade trackers often feature intuitive user interfaces and are accessible via various devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. They may also offer integration with other educational tools and platforms, enhancing the overall learning experience. Additional features might include attendance tracking, assignment deadlines, and communication tools for teachers, students, and parents.

CONCLUSION:
Overall, a student grade tracker fosters a collaborative and transparent educational environment, promoting accountability and continuous improvement for all stakeholders involved. By leveraging technology, it transforms traditional grade management into a more efficient and effective process, contributing to better academic outcomes.
